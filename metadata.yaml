description: The fate of Harry Tristram's inheritance hangs on a technicality of the
  calendar, and the outcome is not in Harry's favor. All he wants is to own the House
  of Blent, but unless he can convince himself to marry someone he does not love,
  Harry may have to relinquish his estate to his cousin Cecily. Readers will relish
  the story's ingenious denouement and Hope's precise character study.
